## Introduction

This project was developed as part of a collaborative effort between [Jordan] and [Roxy] over a two-day pair programming session. The primary objective was to enhance our teamwork skills through hands-on experience with planning, communication, and coding in tandem. 

**Key Aspects of the Project:**

- **Collaborative Development:** Working closely with a partner allowed us to practice and refine our pair programming techniques. We alternated between the roles of driver (writing code) and navigator (reviewing code and suggesting improvements), ensuring a productive and balanced approach to development.
  
- **Effective Planning:** Before diving into the code, we spent time planning the projectâ€™s scope, breaking down tasks, and defining clear objectives. This planning phase was crucial for aligning our goals and ensuring a smooth development process.

- **Clear Communication:** Since we worked together throughout the entire project, we maintained constant communication. We discussed every aspect of the project in real-time, which helped us make decisions quickly and efficiently, ensuring that our development process was coherent and well-coordinated.

- **Collaborative Decision-Making:** Decisions on architecture, design, and implementation were made together, leveraging each other's strengths and perspectives. This collaborative approach not only enhanced the quality of the final product but also enriched our learning experience.

**Project Overview:**

While the primary goal was to strengthen our collaborative skills, the project itself is used to manage transactions and uses the transactions data to generate reports. This allowed us to apply our pair programming techniques in a practical setting and deliver a functional solution within the given timeframe.

This project showcases our ability to work as a team and demonstrates the effective application of pair programming methodologies. We believe that this experience has significantly contributed to our development as collaborative software engineers.
